## This is what I'm up to...

1. Trying to get better at markdown.
2. Kind of doubling down on my Linux and Vim obsession.
3. Working on doing a really nice profile - yeah, early days innit.
4. Working on a project I've had in my head for a time...
5. Reiterating things until I'm more or less happy.
6. At the same time getting past some perfectionism, imposter and self esteem stuff.
7. Making connections with people - search for the community I want to work for/with.
